# The Genius Simulator

My crappy static website attempt at simulating The Genius games using RNG.

It's currently extremely bare-bones. As of now, it takes in 13 players and uses pure
RNG to determine who wins anything and everything.

There are plans for future features, like implementing MMs with more than one player winning,
extra player counts, and custom MMs/DMs.
