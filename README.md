# The Genius Simulator

My crappy static website attempt at simulating The Genius games using RNG.

It's currently pretty bare-bones. As of now, it takes in any amount of players and uses pure
RNG to determine who wins anything and everything. It can also generate random new Genius
Main Matches. This feature was so popular it has its own subpage, games.html, where you can
generate Main Matches and Death Matches as much as you desire.

There are plans for future features, such as more flexibility in MM design, more details
on the daily happenings of an episode, and a mode that has traits and less RNG.
